# Useful Scripts

## Background
This has been set up as a centralised personal repo that will contain a collection of useful scripts that I have used 
one and might come in hand again later.

## Commands
### Add columns to an existing csv

This script takes two command line arguments
1) The name of the csv file you want to add the columns to.
2) The name of the output csv file you want to create.


```shell
python3 add_column_to_csv.py
```

### Create or edit a parquet file
Edit the source code before running this, so it is relevant for your use case.
```shell
python3 editing_parquets.py
```

## Installation/ Getting Started

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
