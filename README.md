# Useful Scripts

## Background
This has been set up as a centralised personal repo that will contain a collection of useful scripts that I have used 
one and might come in hand again later.

## Commands
### Add columns to an existing csv
Edit the source code before running this, so it is relevant for your use case.
```shell
python3 add_column_to_csv.py
```

## Installation/ Getting Started

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
